Each constructor must prove the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thrm:privacy-proof}
    For every setting of the input parameters to each constructor,
    an exception is raised or a valid transformation is returned with the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textup{Appropriate output domain.} \\
        For every element $v$ in \texttt{input\_domain}, $function(v)$ is in \texttt{output\_domain}.
        
        \item \textup{Domain-metric compatibility.} \\
        The \texttt{input\_domain} matches one of the possible domains listed in the definition of \texttt{input\_metric}, 
        and likewise \texttt{output\_domain} matches one of the possible domains listed in the definition of \texttt{output\_metric}.
        
        \item \textup{Stability guarantee.} \\
        For every pair of elements \texttt{v}, \texttt{w} in \texttt{input\_domain} and for every $(d_{in}, d_{out})$,
        if \texttt{v}, \texttt{w} are $d_{in}$-close under \texttt{input\_metric} and $\texttt{relation}(d_{in}, d_{out}) = True$,
        then \texttt{function(v)}, \texttt{function(w)} are $d_{out}$-close under \texttt{output\_metric}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
